Commando: A One Man Army is a 2013 Hindi action thriller film directed by Dilip Ghosh and produced by Vipul Amrutlal Shah and Reliance Entertainment. It is the first installment of the Commando film series, starring Vidyut Jammwal, Pooja Chopra and Jaideep Ahlawat in the lead roles. The film showcases Jammwal's martial arts skills and stunts, as he plays a disavowed Indian commando who helps a woman escape from a ruthless gangster.
 
The film's plot revolves around Karan Singh Dogra (Jammwal), a Para SF captain who is captured by the Chinese army when his helicopter crashes on the border during a training exercise. He is branded as a spy and tortured for a year, but he manages to escape and crosses the border into India. There, he meets Simrit (Chopra), a young woman who is running away from Amrit Kanwal Singh (Ahlawat), also known as AK-74, a powerful politician and gangster who wants to marry her for his own gain. Karan decides to protect Simrit from AK-74 and his goons, who chase them into the jungle. Karan uses his guerilla warfare and jungle survival skills to fight off the enemies, while also uncovering a conspiracy involving AK-74 and the Chinese.

The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised Jammwal's action sequences and performance, but criticized the weak script, direction and Chopra's role. The film was a moderate success at the box office, earning â¹269 million (India) against a budget of â¹170 million. It was followed by two sequels, Commando 2: The Black Money Trail in 2017 and Commando 3 in 2019.
 
If you are looking for a fast-paced and action-packed film with impressive stunts and martial arts, Commando: A One Man Army might be a good choice for you. However, if you are expecting a strong story, character development or logic, you might be disappointed.
  
The film's highlights are undoubtedly the action scenes, which showcase Jammwal's agility, strength and skill in various forms of combat. He performs all his own stunts, without any body doubles or wires, and uses the Indian martial art of Kalaripayattu, as well as other techniques like parkour, sword fighting and hand-to-hand combat. Some of the most memorable sequences include a chase on a bus roof, a fight in a water tank, a one-man army assault on AK-74's mansion and a final showdown on a bridge. Jammwal also displays his charisma and intensity as the lead character, who is loyal, brave and patriotic.
 
The film's drawbacks are mainly the weak plot, which is full of clichÃ©s, loopholes and inconsistencies. The film does not explain how Karan escaped from the Chinese custody, how he survived in the jungle for a year, how he acquired weapons and ammunition, or how he knew about AK-74's involvement with the Chinese. The film also relies on coincidences and conveniences to move the story forward, such as Karan meeting Simrit at the right time and place, or AK-74's men always missing their shots. The film also suffers from poor direction, editing and cinematography, which make some scenes confusing or choppy.
 
The film's other major flaw is the female lead character, Simrit, who is portrayed as a damsel in distress who needs Karan to save her from every situation. She has no agency or personality of her own, and only serves as a romantic interest and a plot device for Karan. She is also given some cringe-worthy dialogues and scenes, such as when she tries to seduce Karan in the jungle, or when she sings a song while being chased by goons. Chopra's performance is also mediocre and unconvincing.
